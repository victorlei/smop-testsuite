Some hints for using f2matlab.



Put all of your fortran source (modules, subroutines, functions, and the main program) all in
one text file, then use f2matlab on that. f2matlab can figure out include files on its own,
though.


If there is an error, funstr{i} usually contains the line that f2matlab had a problem on.


One source of bugs is the difference in the way fortran and Matlab perform loops. 
On exit from
   do i=1,5
   end do
i=6 in fortran, however i=5 in a similar Matlab loop.

    
f2matlab works best on f90 sources written in a "standard" way. One way to get closer to this
standard is to use 
plusFORT's spag on your program before trying f2matlab.

fortran doesn't distinguish between column and row vectors, and this may cause problems with
the translation as there may be a size mismatch in matlab with some mathematical
operations.
