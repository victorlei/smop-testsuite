The installation of f2matlab is straightforward. Simply gunzip and untar the source files
into some convenint directory. Note that f2matlab does not make its own directory. So make a
f2matlab directory somewhere and in that dir:
tar zxvf source.tar.gz

and put this directory onto the matlab path.

At this point, testing of f2matlab.m can be accomplished by following the examples section
of the README file.
