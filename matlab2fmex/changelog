04/29/02 - Fixed a bug not requiring integers in some subscripts
07/11/02 - There has been ongoing development, though this file has not
        been updated. The major change has been in the interface. Explicit
	fortran pointers are no longer used, but Matlab library routines
	line mxCopyPtrToReal8 are used instead. This makes matlab2fmex
	available to a much broader range of compilers.
